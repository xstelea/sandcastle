# Sandcastle

A TypeScript library for orchestrating AI coding agents in isolated Docker containers. Sandcastle handles the hard parts — building worktrees, invoking the agent, and merging commits back — so you can run AFK agents with a single `run()`.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Quick start

1. Install the package:

```bash
npm install @ai-hero/sandcastle
```

2. Run `sandcastle init`. This scaffolds a `.sandcastle` directory with all the files needed.

```bash
npx sandcastle init
```

3. Edit `.sandcastle/.env` and fill in your default values for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

```bash
cp .sandcastle/.env.example .sandcastle/.env
```

4. Run the `.sandcastle/main.ts` file with `npx tsx`

```bash
npx tsx .sandcastle/main.ts
```

```typescript
// 3. Run the agent via the JS API
import { run } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";

await run({
  promptFile: ".sandcastle/prompt.md",
});
```

## API

Sandcastle exports a programmatic `run()` function for use in scripts, CI pipelines, or custom tooling.

```typescript
import { run } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";

const result = await run({
  // Prompt source — provide one of these, not both:
  promptFile: ".sandcastle/prompt.md", // path to a prompt file (default: .sandcastle/prompt.md)
  // prompt: "Fix issue #42 in this repo", // OR an inline prompt string

  // Values substituted for {{KEY}} placeholders in the prompt.
  promptArgs: {
    ISSUE_NUMBER: "42",
  },

  // Maximum number of agent iterations to run before stopping. Default: 1
  maxIterations: 5,

  // Branch the agent commits to inside the sandbox.
  branch: "agent/fix-42",

  // Claude model passed to the agent. Default: "claude-opus-4-6"
  model: "claude-opus-4-6",

  // Docker image used for the sandbox. Default: "sandcastle:<repo-dir-name>"
  imageName: "sandcastle:local",

  // Display name for this run, shown as a prefix in log output.
  name: "fix-issue-42",

  // Lifecycle hooks — arrays of shell commands run sequentially inside the sandbox.
  hooks: {
    // Runs after the worktree is mounted into the sandbox.
    onSandboxReady: [{ command: "npm install" }],
  },

  // Host-relative file paths to copy into the worktree before the container starts.
  copyToSandbox: [".env"],

  // How to record progress. Default: write to a file under .sandcastle/logs/
  logging: { type: "file", path: ".sandcastle/logs/my-run.log" },
  // logging: { type: "stdout" }, // OR render an interactive UI in the terminal

  // String the agent emits to end the iteration loop early.
  // Default: "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>"
  completionSignal: "<promise>COMPLETE</promise>",

  // Maximum wall-clock time for the entire run, in seconds. Default: 1200 (20 minutes)
  timeoutSeconds: 1200,
});

console.log(result.iterationsRun); // number of iterations executed
console.log(result.wasCompletionSignalDetected); // true if agent emitted <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
console.log(result.commits); // array of { sha } for commits created
console.log(result.branch); // target branch name
```

## Prompts

Sandcastle uses a flexible prompt system. You write the prompt, and the engine executes it — no opinions about workflow, task management, or context sources are imposed.

### Prompt resolution

The prompt is resolved from one of three sources (in order of precedence):

1. `prompt: "inline string"` — pass an inline prompt directly via `RunOptions`
2. `promptFile: "./path/to/prompt.md"` — point to a specific file via `RunOptions`
3. `.sandcastle/prompt.md` — default location (created by `sandcastle init`)

`prompt` and `promptFile` are mutually exclusive — providing both is an error.

### Dynamic context with `` !`command` ``

Use `` !`command` `` expressions in your prompt to pull in dynamic context. Each expression is replaced with the command's stdout before the prompt is sent to the agent.

Commands run **inside the sandbox** after the worktree is mounted and `onSandboxReady` hooks complete, so they see the same repo state the agent sees (including installed dependencies).

```markdown
# Open issues

!`gh issue list --state open --label Sandcastle --json number,title,body,comments,labels --limit 20`

# Recent commits

!`git log --oneline -10`
```

If any command exits with a non-zero code, the run fails immediately with an error.

### Prompt arguments with `{{KEY}}`

Use `{{KEY}}` placeholders in your prompt to inject values from the `promptArgs` option. This is useful for reusing the same prompt file across multiple runs with different parameters.

```typescript
import { run } from "@ai-hero/sandcastle";

await run({
  promptFile: "./my-prompt.md",
  promptArgs: { ISSUE_NUMBER: 42, PRIORITY: "high" },
});
```

In the prompt file:

```markdown
Work on issue #{{ISSUE_NUMBER}} (priority: {{PRIORITY}}).
```

Prompt argument substitution runs on the host before shell expression expansion, so `{{KEY}}` placeholders inside `` !`command` `` expressions are replaced first:

```markdown
!`gh issue view {{ISSUE_NUMBER}} --json body -q .body`
```

A `{{KEY}}` placeholder with no matching prompt argument is an error. Unused prompt arguments produce a warning.

### Early termination with `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`

When the agent outputs `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`, the orchestrator stops the iteration loop early. This is a convention you document in your prompt for the agent to follow — the engine never injects it.

This is useful for task-based workflows where the agent should stop once it has finished, rather than running all remaining iterations.

### Templates

`sandcastle init` prompts you to choose a template, which scaffolds a ready-to-use prompt and `main.ts` suited to a specific workflow. Four templates are available:

| Template              | Description                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blank`               | Bare scaffold — write your own prompt and orchestration                 |
| `simple-loop`         | Picks GitHub issues one by one and closes them                          |
| `sequential-reviewer` | Implements issues one by one, with a code review step after each        |
| `parallel-planner`    | Plans parallelizable issues, executes on separate branches, then merges |

Select a template during `sandcastle init` when prompted, or re-run init in a fresh repo to try a different one.

## CLI commands

### `sandcastle init`

Scaffolds the `.sandcastle/` config directory and builds the Docker image. This is the first command you run in a new repo.

| Option         | Required | Default            | Description       |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `--image-name` | No       | `sandcastle:local` | Docker image name |

Creates the following files:

```
.sandcastle/
├── Dockerfile      # Sandbox environment (customize as needed)
├── prompt.md       # Agent instructions
├── .env.example    # Token placeholders
└── .gitignore      # Ignores .env, patches/, logs/
```

Errors if `.sandcastle/` already exists to prevent overwriting customizations.

### `sandcastle build-image`

Rebuilds the Docker image from an existing `.sandcastle/` directory. Use this after modifying the Dockerfile.

| Option         | Required | Default            | Description                                                                       |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--image-name` | No       | `sandcastle:local` | Docker image name                                                                 |
| `--dockerfile` | No       | —                  | Path to a custom Dockerfile (build context will be the current working directory) |

### `sandcastle interactive`

Opens an interactive Claude Code session inside the sandbox. Creates a worktree, bind-mounts it into the sandbox, launches Claude with TTY passthrough, and merges commits back when you exit.

| Option         | Required | Default            | Description                |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `--image-name` | No       | `sandcastle:local` | Docker image name          |
| `--model`      | No       | `claude-opus-4-6`  | Model to use for the agent |

### `sandcastle remove-image`

Removes the Docker image.

| Option         | Required | Default            | Description       |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| `--image-name` | No       | `sandcastle:local` | Docker image name |

### `RunOptions`

| `imageName`        | string     | `sandcastle:<repo-dir-name>`  | Docker image name for the sandbox                               |
| `name`             | string     | —                             | Display name for the run, shown as a prefix in log output       |

| `logFilePath`                 | string?     | Path to the log file (only when logging to a file) |

Environment variables are resolved automatically from `.sandcastle/.env` and `process.env` — no need to pass them to the API. The required variables depend on the **agent provider** (see `sandcastle init` output for details).

## Configuration

### Config directory (`.sandcastle/`)

All per-repo sandbox configuration lives in `.sandcastle/`. Run `sandcastle init` to create it.

### Custom Dockerfile

The `.sandcastle/Dockerfile` controls the sandbox environment. The default template installs:

- **Node.js 22** (base image)
- **git**, **curl**, **jq** (system dependencies)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`)
- **Claude Code CLI**
- A non-root `agent` user (required — Claude runs as this user)

When customizing the Dockerfile, ensure you keep:

- A non-root user (the default `agent` user) for Claude to run as
- `git` (required for commits and branch operations)
- `gh` (required for issue fetching)
- Claude Code CLI installed and on PATH

Add your project-specific dependencies (e.g., language runtimes, build tools) to the Dockerfile as needed.

### Hooks

Hooks are arrays of `{ "command": "..." }` objects executed sequentially inside the sandbox. If any command exits with a non-zero code, execution stops immediately with an error.

| Hook             | When it runs               | Working directory      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `onSandboxReady` | After the sandbox is ready | Sandbox repo directory |

**`onSandboxReady`** runs after the worktree is mounted into the sandbox. Use it for dependency installation or build steps (e.g., `npm install`).

Pass hooks programmatically via `run()`:

```ts
await run({
  hooks: {
    onSandboxReady: [{ command: "npm install" }],
  },
  // ...
});
```

## How it works

Sandcastle uses a worktree-based architecture for direct, zero-sync agent execution:

- **Worktree**: Sandcastle creates a git worktree on the host at `.sandcastle/worktrees/`. The worktree is a real checkout of your repo — no copying or bundling required.
- **Bind-mount**: The worktree directory is bind-mounted into the sandbox container as the agent's working directory. The agent writes directly to the host filesystem through the mount.
- **No sync needed**: Because the agent writes directly to the host filesystem, there are no sync-in or sync-out operations. Commits made by the agent are immediately visible on the host.
- **Merge back**: After the run completes, the temp worktree branch is fast-forward merged back to the target branch, and the worktree is cleaned up.

This approach eliminates the complexity of patch-based sync and ensures the agent always works with the exact repo state on the host.
