Use `npm run typecheck` for type checking.

Check @UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md for terminology questions.

For user-facing changes, add a changeset to `.changeset`. Check all changesets there first to see if there are duplicates. We use `@changesets/cli`, but you can create/edit the file manually. Make all changesets `patch` (since we're pre-1.0). Use `package.json#name` for the name.

When changing public-facing behavior, check `README.md` to see if the documentation needs updating.

When creating GitHub issues that Sandcastle should work on, add the `ready-for-agent` label to them.
